### Hi there 👋  

I'm a fullstack developer with three years of experience and lots of knowledge to acquire.

My current occupation is in industrial environment projects in the MES/MOM area, learning technologies such as Siemens Opcenter or Simatic IT. 
Most of my code is written in C# or Javascript/Typescript frameworks, but in this profile you will find projects coded in C or Java from my school days.
